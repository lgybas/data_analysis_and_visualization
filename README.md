# data_analysis_and_visualization
 Analysing Business Data for Discount recommendations with python and seaborn.
 
 
 There are 4 csv-files, which contain the purchase information of an online shop. 
 Most products have been sold with discounts, so the question was whether or not the company should continue to give discounts. 
 The challenges of the project were to clean the data, analyze it and visualize the insights. 
 
 Happy exploring!
